                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm Teminiolwa Adekoya, a passionate full-stack developer who discovered the world of programming 
                    through curiosity and a desire to solve real-world problems. My journey began with simple HTML 
                    websites and has evolved into building complex, accessible applications that make a difference 
                    in people's lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What drives me is the intersection of technology and human experience. I believe that great 
                    software isn't just about clean code—it's about creating inclusive, intuitive experiences 
                    that empower users regardless of their technical background or abilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond coding, I find inspiration in music, photography, and reading about emerging technologies. 
                    These diverse interests help me approach problems from different angles and bring creativity 
                    to my technical work.

                        <h3>System Design & Architecture</h3>
                        <p>
                            While I'm comfortable with individual components, I'm still learning how to design 
                            large-scale systems and make architectural decisions that will scale effectively. 
                            I'm actively studying design patterns and system architecture principles.

                        <p>
                            I can solve most coding problems, but I want to improve my ability to write highly 
                            optimized algorithms and understand complex time/space complexity scenarios. 
                            Regular practice on coding platforms is helping me grow in this area.

                            While I understand the basics of deployment, I'm working to better understand 
                            CI/CD pipelines, containerization with Docker, and cloud infrastructure management. 
                            These skills are crucial for modern development workflows.

                            Explaining complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders is a skill 
                            I'm continuously refining. I practice through code reviews, documentation, 
                            and presenting technical solutions to diverse audiences.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remember this moment of uncertainty mixed with excitement. Right now, you're at the 
                        beginning of an incredible journey, and while the path ahead seems challenging, 
                        trust in your ability to learn and grow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Don't forget the curiosity that brought you here. When imposter syndrome creeps in 
                        (and it will), remember that every expert was once a beginner. Your unique perspective 
                        and experiences are valuable—don't try to be someone else, be the best version of yourself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stay humble, but also recognize your growth. Help others along the way, just as others 
                        are helping you now. The developer community is built on shared knowledge and mutual support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most importantly, remember that technology is a tool for human connection and empowerment. 
                        Build things that matter, solve problems that affect real people, and never lose sight 
                        of the human element in everything you create.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Keep coding, keep learning, keep growing.</strong>

                <h2>Extra Thoughts & Reflections</h2>
                <div class="extra-thoughts">
                    <h3>On Learning</h3>
                    <p>
                        The tech industry moves fast, but I've learned that fundamentals matter more than 
                        chasing every new framework. A solid understanding of core concepts allows you to 
                        adapt to any technology stack.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>On Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>
                        Building accessible applications isn't just about compliance—it's about human dignity 
                        and inclusion. Every line of code is an opportunity to make the web more welcoming 
                        for everyone.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>On Problem-Solving</h3>
                    <p>
                        The best solutions often come from understanding the problem deeply rather than 
                        jumping straight to coding. Taking time to research, plan, and consider edge cases 
                        saves hours of debugging later.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>On Community</h3>
                    <p>
                        Programming might seem like a solitary activity, but it's fundamentally collaborative. 
                        The open source community, Stack Overflow, and developer forums remind us that 
                        we're all learning together.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm excited about the future of web development, particularly around WebAssembly, 
                        progressive web apps, and AI-assisted development tools. These technologies will 
                        open new possibilities for creating powerful, accessible applications.
